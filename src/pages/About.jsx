              Curious and easy-going Software Engineer and IT Specialist. My
              blended background in IT and Customer Service has allowed me to see
              firsthand the way individuals use software and technology, engage
              customers, and hear most feedback about products enabling me to
              understand the customer's needs.

              I love engaging my curiosity to learn how stuff works and breaks. I
              make use of my inquisitive mind to gather all the facts, create test
              cases, and search for ways to improve and enhance whatever I'm
              working on to ensure the best quality.
